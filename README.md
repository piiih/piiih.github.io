# PHP Study Guide

## What?

Originally PHP Study Guide was a small project that provides step by step guide
on information needed to pass [PHP5.3 ZCE certification][1].

For now it aims to go little bit beyond the Zend Certification and is a good
place to start your experience with PHP5.3 or, if you are already an experienced
web developer, to return to the basics and remember some details.

>For advanced topics and best practices, please, also consider to take a look 
at new, awesome and promissing project [PHP The Right Way][2] by [Josh Lockhart][3] 
with some support of PHP community.

## Where?

At the moment project is placed at [http://php-guide.evercodelab.com/][4] and
hosted on [GitHub.Pages](http://pages.github.com).

## Sources

All content is assembled from different sources and tutorials.
